This repository propose some tips and tricks to help install and configure NIS.

---

You can find some macro files `*.mac` in the **Macros** folder.
You can copy the files as such or get inspiration from them.

> [!warning] in order to run in NIS the file extension has to be `.mac`

---

The **NIS_Install** Folder includes files that have to be installed in `C:/Nikon Service`

Then from NIS it will be possible to run a macro `Layout configuration.mac` that will install a default layout and set NIS windows a nice way :)

Some GA3 functions are also included (as well as the method to install them in NIS) to easily save table in `.csv` for batch run (or individual run)

ENJOY !! :)
